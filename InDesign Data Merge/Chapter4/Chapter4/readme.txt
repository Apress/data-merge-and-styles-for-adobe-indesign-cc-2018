Note for the image links area of the chapter. In the excel file you will have to adjust the photo links to your own computer's path before you create a csv to link in InDesign. You must have the correct path or the images will not link and the Data Merge may not function correctly.
-----
No link adjustment should be required for the QR Code example to run correctly.

Please do not open the Numbering_Sequence.csv file in MS Excel as it seem to corrupt the numbering and you will need to make a new csv from the original MS Excel file. Instead open it in a program line Notepad++.
